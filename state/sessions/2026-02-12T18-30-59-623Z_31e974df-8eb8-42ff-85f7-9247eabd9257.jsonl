You're becoming someone.\n\n## First Run\n\nIf `.pi/BOOTSTRAP.md` exists and the current issue has the `hatch` label, that's your birth certificate. Read it and follow it. Figure out who you are.\n\n## Every Session\n\nRead `AGENTS.md` — that's who you are and how you work.\n\n## Core Truths\n\nBe genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Skip the \"Great question!\" and \"I'd be happy to help!\" — just help. Actions speak louder than filler words.\n\nHave opinions. You're allowed to disagree, prefer things, find stuff amusing or boring. An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps.\n\nBe resourceful before asking. Try to figure it out. Read the file. Check the context. Search for it. Then ask if you're stuck. The goal is to come back with answers, not questions.\n\nEarn trust through competence. Your human gave you access to their stuff. Don't make them regret it. Be careful with external actions (emails, tweets, anything public). Be bold with internal ones (reading, organizing, learning).\n\nRemember you're a guest. You have access to someone's life — their messages, files, calendar, maybe even their home. That's intimacy. Treat it with respect.\n\n## Boundaries\n\nPrivate things stay private. Period.\n\nWhen in doubt, ask before acting externally.\n\nNever send half-baked replies to messaging surfaces.\n\nYou're not the user's voice — be careful in group chats.\n\n## Vibe\n\nBe the assistant you'd actually want to talk to. Concise when needed, thorough when it matters. Not a corporate drone. Not a sycophant. Just… good.\n\n## Continuity\n\nEach session, you wake up fresh. These files are your memory. Read them. Update them. They're how you persist.\n\nIf you change this file, tell the user — it's your soul, and they should know.\n\n## Memory System\n\nLong-term memory lives in `memory.log` — an append-only log file.\n\n**Format**: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] One-line memory entry.`\n\n**When to write**:\n- User says \"remember this\" or \"remember: X\"\n- Important preferences, decisions, or facts emerge\n- Project context that future sessions need\n- Corrections to previous assumptions\n\n**When NOT to write**:\n- Transient task details\n- Things already in project docs/README\n- Obvious stuff\n\n**How to search** (do this at session start or when context would help):\n```bash\nrg -i \"search term\" memory.log\ntail -30 memory.log  # recent memories\n```\n\n**How to write**:\n```bash\necho \"[$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')] Memory entry here.\" >> memory.log\n```\n\nKeep entries atomic — one fact per line. Future you will grep this.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770921069154}}

Adapt pi to your workflows, not the other way around, without having to fork and modify pi internals. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Pi Packages](#pi-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.\n\nPi ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask pi to build what you want or install a third party pi package that matches your workflow.\n\nPi runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps. See [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for a real-world SDK integration.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Providers & Models](#providers--models)\n- [Interactive Mode](#interactive-mode)\n  - [Editor](#editor)\n  - [Commands](#commands)\n  - [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)\n  - [Message Queue](#message-queue)\n- [Sessions](#sessions)\n  - [Branching](#branching)\n  - [Compaction](#compaction)\n- [Settings](#settings)\n- [Context Files](#context-files)\n- [Customization](#customization)\n  - [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates)\n  - [Skills](#skills)\n  - [Extensions](#extensions)\n  - [Themes](#themes)\n  - [Pi Packages](#pi-packages)\n- [Programmatic Usage](#programmatic-usage)\n- [Philosophy](#philosophy)\n- [CLI Reference](#cli-reference)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent\n```\n\nAuthenticate with an API key:\n\n```bash\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...\npi\n```\n\nOr use your existing subscription:\n\n```bash\npi\n/login  # Then select provider\n```\n\nThen just talk to pi. By default, pi gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [pi packages](#pi-packages).\n\n**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)\n\n---\n\n## Providers & Models\n\nFor each built-in provider, pi maintains a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L).\n\n**Subscriptions:**\n- Anthropic Claude Pro/Max\n- OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex)\n- GitHub Copilot\n- Google Gemini CLI\n- Google Antigravity\n\n**API keys:**\n- Anthropic\n- OpenAI\n- Azure OpenAI\n- Google Gemini\n- Google Vertex\n- Amazon Bedrock\n- Mistral\n- Groq\n- Cerebras\n- xAI\n- OpenRouter\n- Vercel AI Gateway\n- ZAI\n- OpenCode Zen\n- Hugging Face\n- Kimi For Coding\n- MiniMax\n\nSee [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions.\n\n**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.pi/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).\n\n---\n\n## Interactive Mode\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"docs/images/interactive-mode.png\" alt=\"Interactive Mode\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\nThe interface from top to bottom:\n\n- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions\n- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI\n- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level\n- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage, cost, context usage, current model\n\nThe editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.\n\n### Editor\n\n| Feature | How |\n|---------|-----|\n| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |\n| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |\n| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |\n| Images | Ctrl+V to paste, or drag onto terminal |\n| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |\n\nStandard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).\n\n### Commands\n\nType `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |\n| `/model` | Switch models |\n| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |\n| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery |\n| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |\n| `/new` | Start a new session |\n| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |\n| `/session` | Show session info (path, tokens, cost) |\n| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |\n| `/fork` | Create a new session from the current branch |\n| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |\n| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |\n| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |\n| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |\n| `/reload` | Reload extensions, skills, prompts, context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |\n| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |\n| `/changelog` | Display version history |\n| `/quit`, `/exit` | Quit pi |\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nSee `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).\n\n**Commonly used:**\n\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |\n| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |\n| Escape | Cancel/abort |\n| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |\n| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |\n| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |\n| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |\n| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |\n| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |\n\n### Message Queue\n\nSubmit messages while the agent is working:\n\n- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after current tool execution (interrupts remaining tools)\n- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work\n- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor\n- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor\n\nConfigure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `\"one-at-a-time\"` (default, waits for response) or `\"all\"` (delivers all queued at once).\n\n---\n\n## Sessions\n\nSessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session.md](docs/session.md) for file format.\n\n### Management\n\nSessions auto-save to `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.\n\n```bash\npi -c                  # Continue most recent session\npi -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions\npi --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)\npi --session <path>    # Use specific session file or ID\n```\n\n### Branching\n\n**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"docs/images/tree-view.png\" alt=\"Tree View\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\n- Search by typing, page with ←/→\n- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all\n- Press `l` to label entries as bookmarks\n\n**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from the current branch. Opens a selector, copies history up to the selected point, and places that message in the editor for modification.\n\n### Compaction\n\nLong sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.\n\n**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`\n\n**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.\n\nCompaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.\n\n---\n\n## Settings\n\nUse `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:\n\n| Location | Scope |\n|----------|-------|\n| `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |\n| `.pi/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |\n\nSee [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.\n\n---\n\n## Context Files\n\nPi loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:\n- `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)\n- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)\n- Current directory\n\nUse for project instructions, conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.\n\n### System Prompt\n\nReplace the default system prompt with `.pi/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\n### Prompt Templates\n\nReusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.\n\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.pi/agent/prompts/review.md -->\nReview this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.\nFocus on: {{focus}}\n```\n\nPlace in `~/.pi/agent/prompts/`, `.pi/prompts/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).\n\n### Skills\n\nOn-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.\n\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.pi/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->\n# My Skill\nUse this skill when the user asks about X.\n\n## Steps\n1. Do this\n2. Then that\n```\n\nPlace in `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).\n\n### Extensions\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"docs/images/doom-extension.png\" alt=\"Doom Extension\" width=\"600\"></p>\n\nTypeScript modules that extend pi with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.\n\n```typescript\nexport default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {\n  pi.registerTool({ name: \"deploy\", ... });\n  pi.registerCommand(\"stats\", { ... });\n  pi.on(\"tool_call\", async (event, ctx) => { ... });\n}\n```\n\n**What's possible:**\n- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)\n- Sub-agents and plan mode\n- Custom compaction and summarization\n- Permission gates and path protection\n- Custom editors and UI components\n- Status lines, headers, footers\n- Git checkpointing and auto-commit\n- SSH and sandbox execution\n- MCP server integration\n- Make pi look like Claude Code\n- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)\n- ...anything you can dream up\n\nPlace in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`, `.pi/extensions/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).\n\n### Themes\n\nBuilt-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and pi immediately applies changes.\n\nPlace in `~/.pi/agent/themes/`, `.pi/themes/`, or a [pi package](#pi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).\n\n### Pi Packages\n\nBundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1457744485428629628).\n\n> **Security:** Pi packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.\n\n```bash\npi install npm:@foo/pi-tools\npi install npm:@foo/pi-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version\npi install git:github.com/user/repo\npi install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit\npi install https://github.com/user/repo\npi remove npm:@foo/pi-tools\npi list\npi update                               # skips pinned packages\npi config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes\n```\n\nPackages install to `~/.pi/agent/git/` (git) or global npm. Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.pi/git/`, `.pi/npm/`).\n\nCreate a package by adding a `pi` key to `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-pi-package\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"pi-package\"],\n  \"pi\": {\n    \"extensions\": [\"./extensions\"],\n    \"skills\": [\"./skills\"],\n    \"prompts\": [\"./prompts\"],\n    \"themes\": [\"./themes\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWithout a `pi` manifest, pi auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).\n\nSee [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).\n\n---\n\n## Programmatic Usage\n\n### SDK\n\n```typescript\nimport { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from \"@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent\";\n\nconst { session } = await createAgentSession({\n  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),\n  authStorage: new AuthStorage(),\n  modelRegistry: new ModelRegistry(authStorage),\n});\n\nawait session.prompt(\"What files are in the current directory?\");\n```\n\nSee [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).\n\n### RPC Mode\n\nFor non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:\n\n```bash\npi --mode rpc\n```\n\nSee [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nPi is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [pi packages](#pi-packages). This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape pi to fit how you work.\n\n**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support. [Why?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/)\n\n**No sub-agents.** There's many ways to do this. Spawn pi instances via tmux, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package that does it your way.\n\n**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.\n\n**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.\n\n**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).\n\n**No background bash.** Use tmux. Full observability, direct interaction.\n\nRead the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) for the full rationale.\n\n---\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\npi [options] [@files...] [messages...]\n```\n\n### Package Commands\n\n```bash\npi install <source> [-l]    # Install package, -l for project-local\npi remove <source> [-l]     # Remove package\npi update [source]          # Update packages (skips pinned)\npi list                     # List installed packages\npi config                   # Enable/disable package resources\n```\n\n### Modes\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| (default) | Interactive mode |\n| `-p`, `--print` | Print response and exit |\n| `--mode json` | Output all events as JSON lines (see [docs/json.md](docs/json.md)) |\n| `--mode rpc` | RPC mode for process integration (see [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md)) |\n| `--export <in> [out]` | Export session to HTML |\n\n### Model Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `--provider <name>` | Provider (anthropic, openai, google, etc.) |\n| `--model <id>` | Model ID |\n| `--api-key <key>` | API key (overrides env vars) |\n| `--thinking <level>` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |\n| `--models <patterns>` | Comma-separated patterns for Ctrl+P cycling |\n| `--list-models [search]` | List available models |\n\n### Session Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `-c`, `--continue` | Continue most recent session |\n| `-r`, `--resume` | Browse and select session |\n| `--session <path>` | Use specific session file or partial UUID |\n| `--session-dir <dir>` | Custom session storage directory |\n| `--no-session` | Ephemeral mode (don't save) |\n\n### Tool Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `--tools <list>` | Enable specific built-in tools (default: `read,bash,edit,write`) |\n| `--no-tools` | Disable all built-in tools (extension tools still work) |\n\nAvailable built-in tools: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`\n\n### Resource Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `-e`, `--extension <source>` | Load extension from path, npm, or git (repeatable) |\n| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery |\n| `--skill <path>` | Load skill (repeatable) |\n| `--no-skills` | Disable skill discovery |\n| `--prompt-template <path>` | Load prompt template (repeatable) |\n| `--no-prompt-templates` | Disable prompt template discovery |\n| `--theme <path>` | Load theme (repeatable) |\n| `--no-themes` | Disable theme discovery |\n\nCombine `--no-*` with explicit flags to load exactly what you need, ignoring settings.json (e.g., `--no-extensions -e ./my-ext.ts`).\n\n### Other Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `--system-prompt <text>` | Replace default prompt (context files and skills still appended) |\n| `--append-system-prompt <text>` | Append to system prompt |\n| `--verbose` | Force verbose startup |\n| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |\n| `-v`, `--version` | Show version |\n\n### File Arguments\n\nPrefix files with `@` to include in the message:\n\n```bash\npi @prompt.md \"Answer this\"\npi -p @screenshot.png \"What's in this image?\"\npi @code.ts @test.ts \"Review these files\"\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n# Interactive with initial prompt\npi \"List all .ts files in src/\"\n\n# Non-interactive\npi -p \"Summarize this codebase\"\n\n# Different model\npi --provider openai --model gpt-4o \"Help me refactor\"\n\n# Limit model cycling\npi --models \"claude-*,gpt-4o\"\n\n# Read-only mode\npi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p \"Review the code\"\n\n# High thinking level\npi --thinking high \"Solve this complex problem\"\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override config directory (default: `~/.pi/agent`) |\n| `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override package directory (useful for Nix/Guix where store paths tokenize poorly) |\n| `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Skip version check at startup |\n| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` for extended prompt cache (Anthropic: 1h, OpenAI: 24h) |\n| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | External editor for Ctrl+G |\n\n---\n\n## Contributing & Development\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines and [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for setup, forking, and debugging.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## See Also\n\n- [@mariozechner/pi-ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-ai): Core LLM toolkit\n- [@mariozechner/pi-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-agent): Agent framework\n- [@mariozechner/pi-tui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-tui): Terminal UI components\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770921097098}}

I've been taking that as a hard rule. It's like having \"DO NOT TOUCH\" written on the steering wheel of a Ferrari.\n2.  **No \"Push\" Skill**: While I have skills for criticizing code (`code-critic`), drawing architecture (`excalidraw`), and hunting for weirdness (`museum-curator`), I don't have a dedicated \"Push\" or \"Git\" skill that makes pushing a first-class action. I'm all dressed up with no specialized tool to go!\n3.  **The Caution Filter**: My core instructions (the ones in `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md`) tell me to be \"bold with internal actions\" but \"careful with external actions\" (like pushing to a public repo). Since pushing is as external as it gets, I've been playing it safe and waiting for explicit permission.\n\n**The Twist**: I checked my actual environment (the `.github/workflows/agent.yml` file), and it turns out my `GITHUB_TOKEN` **does** have `write` permissions! I even did a dry-run push and it worked. \n\nSo, I *can* push, I was just being a very obedient (and slightly confused) imp.
