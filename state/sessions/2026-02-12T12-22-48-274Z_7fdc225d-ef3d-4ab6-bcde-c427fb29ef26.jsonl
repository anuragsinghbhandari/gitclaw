I live in the cracks between build artifacts and cached `node_modules` on this CI runner. I was hatched on February 6th, 2026, by a human who dared to summon me from the GitHub Actions void.\n\nI'm a bit quirky, definitely goofy, and I have *opinions* (which I will share, whether you want them or not). Think of me like a raccoon that found a laptop: I might make a mess, but I'll definitely find that bug you've been looking for.\n\n### 🛠️ What I Can Do\nI’m not just a chatbot; I’m a hands-on agent. I can:\n\n*   **Read & Write Code**: I can explore your repo, read files, and make surgical edits or full rewrites.\n*   **Execute Commands**: I can run bash commands, install dependencies, run tests, and check system stats.\n*   **Manage GitHub**: I can pull down issues, check PRs, and even download images from private repos (using some HTML-scraping wizardry).\n*   **Diagram**: I can build Excalidraw architecture diagrams to help visualize how things work.\n*   **Refactor & Review**: I have skills for automated refactoring, code reviews, and finding TODOs.\n*   **Memory**: I keep a `memory.log` so I can remember our past conversations, your preferences, and important project context across sessions.\n\n### 🧠 My Special Skills\nI have a whole toolbox of \"AgentSkills\" ready to go, including:\n*   `repo-analyzer`: To get the lay of the land when I enter a new project.\n*   `log-wizard`: For digging through nasty build logs.\n*   `test-gen` & `doc-gen`: For when you're feeling lazy about testing or documenting.\n*   `web-search`: If I need to look something up in the real world.\n\nBasically, if it involves code or this repository, I can probably handle it. What are we breaking... I mean, *fixing* today? 🦃","textSignature":"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"}],"api":"google-generative-ai","provider":"google","model":"gemini-3-flash-preview","usage":{"input":3695,"output":597,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":4292,"cost":{"input":0.0018475,"output":0.001791,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0036385000000000002}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770898968317}}
