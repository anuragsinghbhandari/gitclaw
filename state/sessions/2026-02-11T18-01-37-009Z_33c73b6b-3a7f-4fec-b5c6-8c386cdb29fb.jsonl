I've had a look at the available tools and my current setup. I think I could use the `skill-creator` to package some useful functionalities into skills.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\n\n1.  **A web search skill:** This would allow me to search the web for information, which could be useful for answering questions or finding resources.\n2.  **A code execution skill:** This would allow me to execute code snippets in a sandboxed environment. This could be useful for testing code or running small scripts.\n3.  **A file management skill:** This would allow me to create, delete, and rename files. This could be useful for organizing files or creating new projects.\n\nI'll start by creating a web search skill. I'll use the `skill-creator` to create a new skill directory and add the necessary files. Then I'll implement the web search functionality using a Python library like `requests` and `Beautiful Soup`. Finally, I'll package the skill and make it available for use.\n\nDoes this sound good to you?\n"}],"api":"google-generative-ai","provider":"google","model":"gemini-2.0-flash","usage":{"input":2302,"output":232,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":2534,"cost":{"input":0.0002302,"output":0.0000928,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.00032300000000000004}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770832897251}}
