Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770867936062}}

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770833310889}}

Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\n- Example: PDF skill with \"Quick Start\" -> \"Merge PDFs\" -> \"Split PDFs\" -> \"Extract Text\"\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Quick Start -> ## Task Category 1 -> ## Task Category 2...\n\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\n- Example: Brand styling with \"Brand Guidelines\" -> \"Colors\" -> \"Typography\" -> \"Features\"\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...\n\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" -> numbered capability list\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...\n\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed.

Audits your test coverage to find missing tests and scaffolds new test files for JS, TS, and Python.\n- **`doc-gen`**: The chronicler. Extracts documentation from your code and audits for undocumented functions or classes.\n\n### 📈 Progress Update\nI've updated our **Infinite Functionalities** backlog (**Issue #9**) to reflect these additions. We now have **12 packaged skills** ready to roll! \n\nI've also added some new ideas to the \"Planned\" section:\n- **`ci-helper`**: For debugging those pesky CI failures.\n- **`security-scanner`**: To keep the bad guys out.\n- **`docker-wizard`**: For when we want to ship this coop in a container.\n\nEverything is packaged into `.skill` files in the root directory.

Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)\\n- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures\\n- Example: DOCX skill with \\\"Workflow Decision Tree\\\" -> \\\"Reading\\\" -> \\\"Creating\\\" -> \\\"Editing\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Workflow Decision Tree -> ## Step 1 -> ## Step 2...\\n\\n**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\\n- Example: PDF skill with \\\"Quick Start\\\" -> \\\"Merge PDFs\\\" -> \\\"Split PDFs\\\" -> \\\"Extract Text\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Quick Start -> ## Task Category 1 -> ## Task Category 2...\\n\\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\\n- Example: Brand styling with \\\"Brand Guidelines\\\" -> \\\"Colors\\\" -> \\\"Typography\\\" -> \\\"Features\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...\\n\\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\\n- Example: Product Management with \\\"Core Capabilities\\\" -> numbered capability list\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...\\n\\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed.

It uses the DuckDuckGo search API to perform searches and extracts snippets from the search results.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nTo use this skill, simply ask a question that requires accessing real-time information from the internet, or explicitly ask to search the web. For example:\\n\\n*   \\\"What is the current weather in London?\\\"\\n*   \\\"Search the web for the latest news about AI.\\\"\\n*   \\\"Find the capital of France.\\\"\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\nThis skill uses the `scripts/web_search.py` script to perform the web search.

Audits your test coverage to find missing tests and scaffolds new test files for JS, TS, and Python.\\n- **`doc-gen`**: The chronicler. Extracts documentation from your code and audits for undocumented functions or classes.\\n\\n### 📈 Progress Update\\nI've updated our **Infinite Functionalities** backlog (**Issue #9**) to reflect these additions. We now have **12 packaged skills** ready to roll! \\n\\nI've also added some new ideas to the \\\"Planned\\\" section:\\n- **`ci-helper`**: For debugging those pesky CI failures.\\n- **`security-scanner`**: To keep the bad guys out.\\n- **`docker-wizard`**: For when we want to ship this coop in a container.\\n\\nEverything is packaged into `.skill` files in the root directory.

Here’s the \"Greatest Hits\" from the output:\n\n### 1. **`github-manager`**\n- **Action**: Listed open issues.\n- **Result**: I see **Issue #9** (our backlog) and **Issue #8** (a test issue) sitting pretty.\n\n### 2. **`repo-analyzer`**\n- **Action**: Mapped the top-level project structure.\n- **Result**: generated a clean tree showing our `lifecycle`, `state`, and `.pi` directories. It knows where it lives!\n\n### 3. **`dependency-helper`**\n- **Action**: Checked for outdated npm packages.\n- **Result**: Clean bill of health! No outdated packages found in `package.json`.\n\n### 4. **`log-wizard`**\n- **Action**: Scanned `memory.log` for any mention of \"skill\".\n- **Result**: Found all our recent milestones, including the addition of Excalidraw and the new skill batch.\n\n### 5. **`performance-auditor`**\n- **Action**: Audited the largest files in the repo.\n- **Result**: The session logs in `state/sessions/` are the biggest heavyweights (up to 230KB). Everything else is nice and lean.\n\n### 6. **`code-critic`**\n- **Action**: Searched for `TODO`s in the codebase.\n- **Result**: Found a few TODOs in `AGENTS.md` regarding documentation and a couple in the `github-manager` skill templates. (I should probably finish those!)\n\n### 7. **`refactor-bot`**\n- **Action**: Checked for naming consistency.\n- **Result**: It flagged a bunch of files using `snake_case` (like `find_todos.sh`) which might be \"inconsistent\" if the user prefers `kebab-case`. It’s a bit of a pedant, but it’s thorough!\n\n### 8. **`test-gen`**\n- **Action**: Audited the `lifecycle/` directory for missing tests.\n- **Result**: **Busted!** `main.ts` and `preinstall.ts` are missing tests. I'll need to scaffold those later.\n\n### 9. **`doc-gen`**\n- **Action**: Checked for undocumented exports in `lifecycle/main.ts`.\n- **Result**: Silence. This either means everything is documented, or the file is so simple the regex didn't catch anything. (Checking the file... it's mostly logic without exported functions).\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The tools are sharp and ready! I've even identified some \"Technical Debt\" (missing tests and TODOs) while demonstrating them. \n\nWhat should we tackle next? Fixing those missing tests, or should I start on the **Security Scanner** skill? 🦃🌻","textSignature":"EjQKMgG+Pvb7zuNf3LJQ2KL6L/mz2BzA9QKEXO5+lBVjMOg8BQfyrlEMnDMHhdIewdMTqh+K"}],"api":"google-generative-ai","provider":"google","model":"gemini-3-flash-preview","usage":{"input":34445,"output":654,"cacheRead":16358,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":35099,"cost":{"input":0.017222499999999998,"output":0.001962,"cacheRead":0.0008179000000000001,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0200024}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770873108424}}

I see you want to take me to Discord. \\\\n\\\\n**Wait a minute!** 🛑 I'm currently living in a GitHub Actions runner. I only wake up when you post an issue or a comment, and I go back to sleep as soon as I'm done. \\\\n\\\\nA Discord bot needs to stay awake 24/7 to respond to messages. If I start the bot here in this Action, it will die the moment the Action finishes.\\\\n\\\\n### 🏗️ How to make this work:\\\\n1.  **Clone this repo** to a long-lived server (like a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or a computer that stays on).\\\\n2.  **Run the bot there.** That way, I'm always available on Discord!\\\\n\\\\n## 🛠️ Setup (On your long-lived server)\\\\n\\\\n1. **Create a Discord Bot**:\\\\n   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\\\\n   - Create a new application and add a Bot.\\\\n   - Enable the **Message Content Intent** under the Bot settings.\\\\n   - Copy your **Bot Token**.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   cd .pi/skills/discord-control && npm install\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Set Environment Variable**:\\\\n   Set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   export DISCORD_TOKEN=\\\\\\\"your-token-here\\\\\\\"\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n## 🚀 Usage\\\\n\\\\nTo start the bot, run:\\\\n```bash\\\\n./scripts/start-bot.sh\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 🌉 Discord -> GitHub Bridge\\\\nI've added a bridge command! If you use `!gitclaw <your message>` in Discord, the bot will use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to **create a new issue** in your repository. This will wake me up here in GitHub Actions to handle your request!\\\\n\\\\n1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set in the bot's environment.\\\\n2. Type `!gitclaw can you refactor the login page?` in Discord.\\\\n3. Watch the GitHub Actions magic happen.\\\\n\\\\nOnce I finish the job on GitHub, I'll comment on the issue. (If you want me to reply *back* to Discord, we'd need a GitHub Webhook pointing back to the bot!)\\\\n\\\\n## ⚠️ Notes\\\\n- I run in the directory where you start the bot.\\\\n- I use the pi SDK to handle your requests.\\\\n- Be careful! I have full access to the system where the bot is running.\\\\n\\\"}],\\\"isError\\\":false,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770868038125}}\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"message\\\",\\\"id\\\":\\\"111f4b2a\\\",\\\"parentId\\\":\\\"bd39b5f5\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"2026-02-12T03:47:21.747Z\\\",\\\"message\\\":{\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"thinking\\\",\\\"thinking\\\":\\\"**Diagnosing the YAML Error**\\\\n\\\\nI've pinpointed a YAML error in the frontmatter.

Storage Analysis\\\\n- **Check File Sizes**: Run `scripts/check_file_sizes.sh` to find the largest files in the repository (ignoring node_modules and .git).\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Benchmarking\\\\n- **Benchmark Command**: Run `scripts/benchmark_command.sh <command>` to execute a command 3 times and see the wall-clock time for each run.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow: Optimization\\\\n1. Identify large assets that could be compressed or moved to LFS.\\\\n2. Benchmark slow tests or build steps to establish a baseline.\\\\n3.

This skill provides setup for controlling the agent via Discord. NOTE: Currently only works if running on a long-lived server.\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# 🦃 Discord Control\\\\n\\\\nHey boss! I see you want to take me to Discord. \\\\n\\\\n**Wait a minute!** 🛑 I'm currently living in a GitHub Actions runner. I only wake up when you post an issue or a comment, and I go back to sleep as soon as I'm done. \\\\n\\\\nA Discord bot needs to stay awake 24/7 to respond to messages. If I start the bot here in this Action, it will die the moment the Action finishes.\\\\n\\\\n### 🏗️ How to make this work:\\\\n1.  **Clone this repo** to a long-lived server (like a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or a computer that stays on).\\\\n2.  **Run the bot there.** That way, I'm always available on Discord!\\\\n\\\\n## 🛠️ Setup (On your long-lived server)\\\\n\\\\n1. **Create a Discord Bot**:\\\\n   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\\\\n   - Create a new application and add a Bot.\\\\n   - Enable the **Message Content Intent** under the Bot settings.\\\\n   - Copy your **Bot Token**.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   cd .pi/skills/discord-control && npm install\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Set Environment Variable**:\\\\n   Set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   export DISCORD_TOKEN=\\\\\\\"your-token-here\\\\\\\"\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n## 🚀 Usage\\\\n\\\\nTo start the bot, run:\\\\n```bash\\\\n./scripts/start-bot.sh\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 🌉 Discord -> GitHub Bridge\\\\nI've added a bridge command! If you use `!gitclaw <your message>` in Discord, the bot will use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to **create a new issue** in your repository. This will wake me up here in GitHub Actions to handle your request!\\\\n\\\\n1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set in the bot's environment.\\\\n2. Type `!gitclaw can you refactor the login page?` in Discord.\\\\n3. Watch the GitHub Actions magic happen.\\\\n\\\\nOnce I finish the job on GitHub, I'll comment on the issue. (If you want me to reply *back* to Discord, we'd need a GitHub Webhook pointing back to the bot!)\\\\n\\\\n## ⚠️ Notes\\\\n- I run in the directory where you start the bot.\\\\n- I use the pi SDK to handle your requests.\\\\n- Be careful! I have full access to the system where the bot is running.\\\\n\\\"}],\\\"isError\\\":false,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770868038125}}\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"message\\\",\\\"id\\\":\\\"111f4b2a\\\",\\\"parentId\\\":\\\"bd39b5f5\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"2026-02-12T03:47:21.747Z\\\",\\\"message\\\":{\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"thinking\\\",\\\"thinking\\\":\\\"**Diagnosing the YAML Error**\\\\n\\\\nI've pinpointed a YAML error in the frontmatter.

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\\n---\\n\\n# Skill Creator\\n\\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\\n\\n## About Skills\\n\\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \\\"onboarding guides\\\" for specific\\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\\n\\n### What Skills Provide\\n\\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Concise is Key\\n\\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\\n\\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \\\"Does Codex really need this explanation?\\\" and \\\"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\\\"\\n\\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\\n\\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\\n\\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\\n\\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\\n\\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\\n\\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\\n\\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\\n\\n### Anatomy of a Skill\\n\\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\\n\\n```\\nskill-name/\\n├── SKILL.md (required)\\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\\n│   │   └── description: (required)\\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\\n```\\n\\n#### SKILL.md (required)\\n\\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\\n\\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\\n\\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\\n\\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\\n\\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\\n\\n##### References (`references/`)\\n\\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\\n\\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\\n\\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\\n\\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\\n\\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\\n\\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\\n\\n- README.md\\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\\n- CHANGELOG.md\\n- etc.\\n\\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\\n\\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\\n\\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\\n\\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\\n\\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\\n\\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\\n\\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\\n\\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\\n\\n```markdown\\n# PDF Processing\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\\n[code example]\\n\\n## Advanced features\\n\\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\\n```\\n\\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\\n\\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\\n\\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\\n\\n```\\nbigquery-skill/\\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\\n└── reference/\\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\\n```\\n\\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\\n\\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\\n\\n```\\ncloud-deploy/\\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\\n└── references/\\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\\n```\\n\\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\\n\\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\\n\\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# DOCX Processing\\n\\n## Creating documents\\n\\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\\n\\n## Editing documents\\n\\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\\n\\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\\n```\\n\\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\\n\\n**Important guidelines:**\\n\\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\\n\\n## Skill Creation Process\\n\\nSkill creation involves these steps:\\n\\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\\n6. Iterate based on real usage\\n\\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\\n\\n### Skill Naming\\n\\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \\\"Plan Mode\\\" -> `plan-mode`).\\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\\n\\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\\n\\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\\n\\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\\n\\n- \\\"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\\\"\\n- \\\"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\\\"\\n- \\\"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\\\"\\n- \\\"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\\\"\\n\\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\\n\\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\\n\\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\\n\\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\\n\\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \\\"Help me rotate this PDF,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \\\"Build me a todo app\\\" or \\\"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \\\"How many users have logged in today?\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\\n\\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\\n\\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\\n\\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\\n\\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\\n```\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n\\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\\n\\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\\n\\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\\n\\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\\n\\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\\n\\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\\n\\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\\n\\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\\n\\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\\n\\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\\n\\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\\n\\n#### Update SKILL.md\\n\\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\\n\\n##### Frontmatter\\n\\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\\n\\n- `name`: The skill name\\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\\n  - Include all \\\"when to use\\\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \\\"When to Use This Skill\\\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \\\"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\\\"\\n\\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\\n\\n##### Body\\n\\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\\n\\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\\n\\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\\n```\\n\\nOptional output directory specification:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\\n```\\n\\nThe packaging script will:\\n\\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\\n   - Description completeness and quality\\n   - File organization and resource references\\n\\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\\n\\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\\n\\n### Step 6: Iterate\\n\\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\\n\\n**Iteration workflow:**\\n\\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\\n4. Implement changes and test again\\n\"}],\"isError\":false,\"timestamp\":1770867936062}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"94b00e94\",\"parentId\":\"2d042744\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T03:45:39.066Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"thinking\",\"thinking\":\"**Defining Core Skills**\\n\\nI've established the foundation by grasping the skill creation instructions.

Here’s the \\\"Greatest Hits\\\" from the output:\\n\\n### 1. **`github-manager`**\\n- **Action**: Listed open issues.\\n- **Result**: I see **Issue #9** (our backlog) and **Issue #8** (a test issue) sitting pretty.\\n\\n### 2. **`repo-analyzer`**\\n- **Action**: Mapped the top-level project structure.\\n- **Result**: generated a clean tree showing our `lifecycle`, `state`, and `.pi` directories. It knows where it lives!\\n\\n### 3. **`dependency-helper`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for outdated npm packages.\\n- **Result**: Clean bill of health! No outdated packages found in `package.json`.\\n\\n### 4. **`log-wizard`**\\n- **Action**: Scanned `memory.log` for any mention of \\\"skill\\\".\\n- **Result**: Found all our recent milestones, including the addition of Excalidraw and the new skill batch.\\n\\n### 5. **`performance-auditor`**\\n- **Action**: Audited the largest files in the repo.\\n- **Result**: The session logs in `state/sessions/` are the biggest heavyweights (up to 230KB). Everything else is nice and lean.\\n\\n### 6. **`code-critic`**\\n- **Action**: Searched for `TODO`s in the codebase.\\n- **Result**: Found a few TODOs in `AGENTS.md` regarding documentation and a couple in the `github-manager` skill templates. (I should probably finish those!)\\n\\n### 7. **`refactor-bot`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for naming consistency.\\n- **Result**: It flagged a bunch of files using `snake_case` (like `find_todos.sh`) which might be \\\"inconsistent\\\" if the user prefers `kebab-case`. It’s a bit of a pedant, but it’s thorough!\\n\\n### 8. **`test-gen`**\\n- **Action**: Audited the `lifecycle/` directory for missing tests.\\n- **Result**: **Busted!** `main.ts` and `preinstall.ts` are missing tests. I'll need to scaffold those later.\\n\\n### 9. **`doc-gen`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for undocumented exports in `lifecycle/main.ts`.\\n- **Result**: Silence. This either means everything is documented, or the file is so simple the regex didn't catch anything. (Checking the file... it's mostly logic without exported functions).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary**: The tools are sharp and ready! I've even identified some \\\"Technical Debt\\\" (missing tests and TODOs) while demonstrating them. \\n\\nWhat should we tackle next? Fixing those missing tests, or should I start on the **Security Scanner** skill? 🦃🌻\",\"textSignature\":\"EjQKMgG+Pvb7zuNf3LJQ2KL6L/mz2BzA9QKEXO5+lBVjMOg8BQfyrlEMnDMHhdIewdMTqh+K\"}],\"api\":\"google-generative-ai\",\"provider\":\"google\",\"model\":\"gemini-3-flash-preview\",\"usage\":{\"input\":34445,\"output\":654,\"cacheRead\":16358,\"cacheWrite\":0,\"totalTokens\":35099,\"cost\":{\"input\":0.017222499999999998,\"output\":0.001962,\"cacheRead\":0.0008179000000000001,\"cacheWrite\":0,\"total\":0.0200024}},\"stopReason\":\"stop\",\"timestamp\":1770873108424}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"e652449c\",\"parentId\":\"28eed4e8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T06:25:23.143Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Clean root folder of .skill files as they are present in .pi/skills\"}],\"timestamp\":1770877523130}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"e3ffa36e\",\"parentId\":\"e652449c\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T06:25:27.592Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"thinking\",\"thinking\":\"**Eliminating Redundancy**\\n\\nI'm aiming to remove the `.skill` files from the root directory because they're already present as source directories within `.pi/skills/`.

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770867936062}}

Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Codex really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n└── reference/\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Skill Naming\n\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \"Plan Mode\" -> `plan-mode`).\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\n\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770833310889}}

Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\n- Example: Product Management with \"Core Capabilities\" -> numbered capability list\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...\n\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed.

It uses the DuckDuckGo search API to perform searches and extracts snippets from the search results.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this skill, simply ask a question that requires accessing real-time information from the internet, or explicitly ask to search the web. For example:\n\n*   \"What is the current weather in London?\"\n*   \"Search the web for the latest news about AI.\"\n*   \"Find the capital of France.\"\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis skill uses the `scripts/web_search.py` script to perform the web search. The script takes a query as input and returns a list of search results.\n\n## Resources\n\n### scripts/\n\nExecutable code (Python) that performs the web search.\n\n#### web_search.py\n\nThis script uses the DuckDuckGo search API to perform web searches and extracts snippets from the search results.\n\n## Resources (optional)\n\nCreate only the resource directories this skill actually needs.

It can review diffs, hunt down `TODO`s, and flag overly complex files that need some love.\n- **`refactor-bot`**: A transformation specialist. Handles bulk search & replace, checks for naming consistency, and sniffs out copy-pasted code for extraction.\n- **`test-gen`**: The quality assurance officer. Audits your test coverage to find missing tests and scaffolds new test files for JS, TS, and Python.\n- **`doc-gen`**: The chronicler. Extracts documentation from your code and audits for undocumented functions or classes.\n\n### 📈 Progress Update\nI've updated our **Infinite Functionalities** backlog (**Issue #9**) to reflect these additions. We now have **12 packaged skills** ready to roll! \n\nI've also added some new ideas to the \"Planned\" section:\n- **`ci-helper`**: For debugging those pesky CI failures.\n- **`security-scanner`**: To keep the bad guys out.\n- **`docker-wizard`**: For when we want to ship this coop in a container.\n\nEverything is packaged into `.skill` files in the root directory.

Task-Based** (best for tool collections)\\n- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities\\n- Example: PDF skill with \\\"Quick Start\\\" -> \\\"Merge PDFs\\\" -> \\\"Split PDFs\\\" -> \\\"Extract Text\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Quick Start -> ## Task Category 1 -> ## Task Category 2...\\n\\n**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\\n- Example: Brand styling with \\\"Brand Guidelines\\\" -> \\\"Colors\\\" -> \\\"Typography\\\" -> \\\"Features\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...\\n\\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\\n- Example: Product Management with \\\"Core Capabilities\\\" -> numbered capability list\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...\\n\\nPatterns can be mixed and matched as needed.

Here’s the \"Greatest Hits\" from the output:\n\n### 1. **`github-manager`**\n- **Action**: Listed open issues.\n- **Result**: I see **Issue #9** (our backlog) and **Issue #8** (a test issue) sitting pretty.\n\n### 2. **`repo-analyzer`**\n- **Action**: Mapped the top-level project structure.\n- **Result**: generated a clean tree showing our `lifecycle`, `state`, and `.pi` directories. It knows where it lives!\n\n### 3. **`dependency-helper`**\n- **Action**: Checked for outdated npm packages.\n- **Result**: Clean bill of health! No outdated packages found in `package.json`.\n\n### 4. **`log-wizard`**\n- **Action**: Scanned `memory.log` for any mention of \"skill\".\n- **Result**: Found all our recent milestones, including the addition of Excalidraw and the new skill batch.\n\n### 5. **`performance-auditor`**\n- **Action**: Audited the largest files in the repo.\n- **Result**: The session logs in `state/sessions/` are the biggest heavyweights (up to 230KB). Everything else is nice and lean.\n\n### 6. **`code-critic`**\n- **Action**: Searched for `TODO`s in the codebase.\n- **Result**: Found a few TODOs in `AGENTS.md` regarding documentation and a couple in the `github-manager` skill templates. (I should probably finish those!)\n\n### 7. **`refactor-bot`**\n- **Action**: Checked for naming consistency.\n- **Result**: It flagged a bunch of files using `snake_case` (like `find_todos.sh`) which might be \"inconsistent\" if the user prefers `kebab-case`. It’s a bit of a pedant, but it’s thorough!\n\n### 8. **`test-gen`**\n- **Action**: Audited the `lifecycle/` directory for missing tests.\n- **Result**: **Busted!** `main.ts` and `preinstall.ts` are missing tests. I'll need to scaffold those later.\n\n### 9. **`doc-gen`**\n- **Action**: Checked for undocumented exports in `lifecycle/main.ts`.\n- **Result**: Silence. This either means everything is documented, or the file is so simple the regex didn't catch anything. (Checking the file... it's mostly logic without exported functions).\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The tools are sharp and ready! I've even identified some \"Technical Debt\" (missing tests and TODOs) while demonstrating them. \n\nWhat should we tackle next? Fixing those missing tests, or should I start on the **Security Scanner** skill? 🦃🌻","textSignature":"EjQKMgG+Pvb7zuNf3LJQ2KL6L/mz2BzA9QKEXO5+lBVjMOg8BQfyrlEMnDMHhdIewdMTqh+K"}],"api":"google-generative-ai","provider":"google","model":"gemini-3-flash-preview","usage":{"input":34445,"output":654,"cacheRead":16358,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":35099,"cost":{"input":0.017222499999999998,"output":0.001962,"cacheRead":0.0008179000000000001,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0200024}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770873108424}}

I see you want to take me to Discord. \\\\n\\\\n**Wait a minute!** 🛑 I'm currently living in a GitHub Actions runner. I only wake up when you post an issue or a comment, and I go back to sleep as soon as I'm done. \\\\n\\\\nA Discord bot needs to stay awake 24/7 to respond to messages. If I start the bot here in this Action, it will die the moment the Action finishes.\\\\n\\\\n### 🏗️ How to make this work:\\\\n1.  **Clone this repo** to a long-lived server (like a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or a computer that stays on).\\\\n2.  **Run the bot there.** That way, I'm always available on Discord!\\\\n\\\\n## 🛠️ Setup (On your long-lived server)\\\\n\\\\n1. **Create a Discord Bot**:\\\\n   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\\\\n   - Create a new application and add a Bot.\\\\n   - Enable the **Message Content Intent** under the Bot settings.\\\\n   - Copy your **Bot Token**.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   cd .pi/skills/discord-control && npm install\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Set Environment Variable**:\\\\n   Set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   export DISCORD_TOKEN=\\\\\\\"your-token-here\\\\\\\"\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n## 🚀 Usage\\\\n\\\\nTo start the bot, run:\\\\n```bash\\\\n./scripts/start-bot.sh\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 🌉 Discord -> GitHub Bridge\\\\nI've added a bridge command! If you use `!gitclaw <your message>` in Discord, the bot will use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to **create a new issue** in your repository. This will wake me up here in GitHub Actions to handle your request!\\\\n\\\\n1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set in the bot's environment.\\\\n2. Type `!gitclaw can you refactor the login page?` in Discord.\\\\n3. Watch the GitHub Actions magic happen.\\\\n\\\\nOnce I finish the job on GitHub, I'll comment on the issue. (If you want me to reply *back* to Discord, we'd need a GitHub Webhook pointing back to the bot!)\\\\n\\\\n## ⚠️ Notes\\\\n- I run in the directory where you start the bot.\\\\n- I use the pi SDK to handle your requests.\\\\n- Be careful! I have full access to the system where the bot is running.\\\\n\\\"}],\\\"isError\\\":false,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770868038125}}\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"message\\\",\\\"id\\\":\\\"111f4b2a\\\",\\\"parentId\\\":\\\"bd39b5f5\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"2026-02-12T03:47:21.747Z\\\",\\\"message\\\":{\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"thinking\\\",\\\"thinking\\\":\\\"**Diagnosing the YAML Error**\\\\n\\\\nI've pinpointed a YAML error in the frontmatter.

Storage Analysis\\\\n- **Check File Sizes**: Run `scripts/check_file_sizes.sh` to find the largest files in the repository (ignoring node_modules and .git).\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Benchmarking\\\\n- **Benchmark Command**: Run `scripts/benchmark_command.sh <command>` to execute a command 3 times and see the wall-clock time for each run.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow: Optimization\\\\n1. Identify large assets that could be compressed or moved to LFS.\\\\n2. Benchmark slow tests or build steps to establish a baseline.\\\\n3.

This skill provides setup for controlling the agent via Discord. NOTE: Currently only works if running on a long-lived server.\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n# 🦃 Discord Control\\\\n\\\\nHey boss! I see you want to take me to Discord. \\\\n\\\\n**Wait a minute!** 🛑 I'm currently living in a GitHub Actions runner. I only wake up when you post an issue or a comment, and I go back to sleep as soon as I'm done. \\\\n\\\\nA Discord bot needs to stay awake 24/7 to respond to messages. If I start the bot here in this Action, it will die the moment the Action finishes.\\\\n\\\\n### 🏗️ How to make this work:\\\\n1.  **Clone this repo** to a long-lived server (like a VPS, Raspberry Pi, or a computer that stays on).\\\\n2.  **Run the bot there.** That way, I'm always available on Discord!\\\\n\\\\n## 🛠️ Setup (On your long-lived server)\\\\n\\\\n1. **Create a Discord Bot**:\\\\n   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\\\\n   - Create a new application and add a Bot.\\\\n   - Enable the **Message Content Intent** under the Bot settings.\\\\n   - Copy your **Bot Token**.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   cd .pi/skills/discord-control && npm install\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n3. **Set Environment Variable**:\\\\n   Set your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.\\\\n   ```bash\\\\n   export DISCORD_TOKEN=\\\\\\\"your-token-here\\\\\\\"\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n## 🚀 Usage\\\\n\\\\nTo start the bot, run:\\\\n```bash\\\\n./scripts/start-bot.sh\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 🌉 Discord -> GitHub Bridge\\\\nI've added a bridge command! If you use `!gitclaw <your message>` in Discord, the bot will use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to **create a new issue** in your repository. This will wake me up here in GitHub Actions to handle your request!\\\\n\\\\n1. Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` are set in the bot's environment.\\\\n2. Type `!gitclaw can you refactor the login page?` in Discord.\\\\n3. Watch the GitHub Actions magic happen.\\\\n\\\\nOnce I finish the job on GitHub, I'll comment on the issue. (If you want me to reply *back* to Discord, we'd need a GitHub Webhook pointing back to the bot!)\\\\n\\\\n## ⚠️ Notes\\\\n- I run in the directory where you start the bot.\\\\n- I use the pi SDK to handle your requests.\\\\n- Be careful! I have full access to the system where the bot is running.\\\\n\\\"}],\\\"isError\\\":false,\\\"timestamp\\\":1770868038125}}\\n{\\\"type\\\":\\\"message\\\",\\\"id\\\":\\\"111f4b2a\\\",\\\"parentId\\\":\\\"bd39b5f5\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"2026-02-12T03:47:21.747Z\\\",\\\"message\\\":{\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"content\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"thinking\\\",\\\"thinking\\\":\\\"**Diagnosing the YAML Error**\\\\n\\\\nI've pinpointed a YAML error in the frontmatter.

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\\n---\\n\\n# Skill Creator\\n\\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\\n\\n## About Skills\\n\\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \\\"onboarding guides\\\" for specific\\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\\n\\n### What Skills Provide\\n\\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Concise is Key\\n\\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\\n\\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \\\"Does Codex really need this explanation?\\\" and \\\"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\\\"\\n\\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\\n\\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\\n\\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\\n\\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\\n\\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\\n\\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\\n\\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\\n\\n### Anatomy of a Skill\\n\\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\\n\\n```\\nskill-name/\\n├── SKILL.md (required)\\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\\n│   │   └── description: (required)\\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\\n```\\n\\n#### SKILL.md (required)\\n\\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\\n\\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\\n\\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\\n\\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\\n\\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\\n\\n##### References (`references/`)\\n\\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\\n\\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\\n\\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\\n\\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\\n\\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\\n\\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\\n\\n- README.md\\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\\n- CHANGELOG.md\\n- etc.\\n\\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\\n\\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\\n\\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\\n\\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\\n\\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\\n\\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\\n\\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\\n\\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\\n\\n```markdown\\n# PDF Processing\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\\n[code example]\\n\\n## Advanced features\\n\\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\\n```\\n\\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\\n\\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\\n\\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\\n\\n```\\nbigquery-skill/\\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\\n└── reference/\\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\\n```\\n\\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\\n\\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\\n\\n```\\ncloud-deploy/\\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\\n└── references/\\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\\n```\\n\\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\\n\\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\\n\\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# DOCX Processing\\n\\n## Creating documents\\n\\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\\n\\n## Editing documents\\n\\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\\n\\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\\n```\\n\\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\\n\\n**Important guidelines:**\\n\\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\\n\\n## Skill Creation Process\\n\\nSkill creation involves these steps:\\n\\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\\n6. Iterate based on real usage\\n\\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\\n\\n### Skill Naming\\n\\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \\\"Plan Mode\\\" -> `plan-mode`).\\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\\n\\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\\n\\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\\n\\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\\n\\n- \\\"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\\\"\\n- \\\"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\\\"\\n- \\\"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\\\"\\n- \\\"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\\\"\\n\\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\\n\\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\\n\\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\\n\\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\\n\\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \\\"Help me rotate this PDF,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \\\"Build me a todo app\\\" or \\\"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \\\"How many users have logged in today?\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\\n\\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\\n\\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\\n\\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\\n\\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\\n```\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n\\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\\n\\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\\n\\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\\n\\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\\n\\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\\n\\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\\n\\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\\n\\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\\n\\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\\n\\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\\n\\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\\n\\n#### Update SKILL.md\\n\\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\\n\\n##### Frontmatter\\n\\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\\n\\n- `name`: The skill name\\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\\n  - Include all \\\"when to use\\\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \\\"When to Use This Skill\\\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \\\"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\\\"\\n\\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\\n\\n##### Body\\n\\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\\n\\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\\n\\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\\n```\\n\\nOptional output directory specification:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\\n```\\n\\nThe packaging script will:\\n\\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\\n   - Description completeness and quality\\n   - File organization and resource references\\n\\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\\n\\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\\n\\n### Step 6: Iterate\\n\\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\\n\\n**Iteration workflow:**\\n\\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\\n4. Implement changes and test again\\n\"}],\"isError\":false,\"timestamp\":1770867936062}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"94b00e94\",\"parentId\":\"2d042744\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T03:45:39.066Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"thinking\",\"thinking\":\"**Defining Core Skills**\\n\\nI've established the foundation by grasping the skill creation instructions.

Here’s the \\\"Greatest Hits\\\" from the output:\\n\\n### 1. **`github-manager`**\\n- **Action**: Listed open issues.\\n- **Result**: I see **Issue #9** (our backlog) and **Issue #8** (a test issue) sitting pretty.\\n\\n### 2. **`repo-analyzer`**\\n- **Action**: Mapped the top-level project structure.\\n- **Result**: generated a clean tree showing our `lifecycle`, `state`, and `.pi` directories. It knows where it lives!\\n\\n### 3. **`dependency-helper`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for outdated npm packages.\\n- **Result**: Clean bill of health! No outdated packages found in `package.json`.\\n\\n### 4. **`log-wizard`**\\n- **Action**: Scanned `memory.log` for any mention of \\\"skill\\\".\\n- **Result**: Found all our recent milestones, including the addition of Excalidraw and the new skill batch.\\n\\n### 5. **`performance-auditor`**\\n- **Action**: Audited the largest files in the repo.\\n- **Result**: The session logs in `state/sessions/` are the biggest heavyweights (up to 230KB). Everything else is nice and lean.\\n\\n### 6. **`code-critic`**\\n- **Action**: Searched for `TODO`s in the codebase.\\n- **Result**: Found a few TODOs in `AGENTS.md` regarding documentation and a couple in the `github-manager` skill templates. (I should probably finish those!)\\n\\n### 7. **`refactor-bot`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for naming consistency.\\n- **Result**: It flagged a bunch of files using `snake_case` (like `find_todos.sh`) which might be \\\"inconsistent\\\" if the user prefers `kebab-case`. It’s a bit of a pedant, but it’s thorough!\\n\\n### 8. **`test-gen`**\\n- **Action**: Audited the `lifecycle/` directory for missing tests.\\n- **Result**: **Busted!** `main.ts` and `preinstall.ts` are missing tests. I'll need to scaffold those later.\\n\\n### 9. **`doc-gen`**\\n- **Action**: Checked for undocumented exports in `lifecycle/main.ts`.\\n- **Result**: Silence. This either means everything is documented, or the file is so simple the regex didn't catch anything. (Checking the file... it's mostly logic without exported functions).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary**: The tools are sharp and ready! I've even identified some \\\"Technical Debt\\\" (missing tests and TODOs) while demonstrating them. \\n\\nWhat should we tackle next? Fixing those missing tests, or should I start on the **Security Scanner** skill? 🦃🌻\",\"textSignature\":\"EjQKMgG+Pvb7zuNf3LJQ2KL6L/mz2BzA9QKEXO5+lBVjMOg8BQfyrlEMnDMHhdIewdMTqh+K\"}],\"api\":\"google-generative-ai\",\"provider\":\"google\",\"model\":\"gemini-3-flash-preview\",\"usage\":{\"input\":34445,\"output\":654,\"cacheRead\":16358,\"cacheWrite\":0,\"totalTokens\":35099,\"cost\":{\"input\":0.017222499999999998,\"output\":0.001962,\"cacheRead\":0.0008179000000000001,\"cacheWrite\":0,\"total\":0.0200024}},\"stopReason\":\"stop\",\"timestamp\":1770873108424}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"e652449c\",\"parentId\":\"28eed4e8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T06:25:23.143Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Clean root folder of .skill files as they are present in .pi/skills\"}],\"timestamp\":1770877523130}}\n{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"e3ffa36e\",\"parentId\":\"e652449c\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T06:25:27.592Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"thinking\",\"thinking\":\"**Eliminating Redundancy**\\n\\nI'm aiming to remove the `.skill` files from the root directory because they're already present as source directories within `.pi/skills/`.

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\\n---\\n\\n# Skill Creator\\n\\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\\n\\n## About Skills\\n\\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \\\"onboarding guides\\\" for specific\\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\\n\\n### What Skills Provide\\n\\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Concise is Key\\n\\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\\n\\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \\\"Does Codex really need this explanation?\\\" and \\\"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\\\"\\n\\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\\n\\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\\n\\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\\n\\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\\n\\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\\n\\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\\n\\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\\n\\n### Anatomy of a Skill\\n\\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\\n\\n```\\nskill-name/\\n├── SKILL.md (required)\\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\\n│   │   └── description: (required)\\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\\n```\\n\\n#### SKILL.md (required)\\n\\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\\n\\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\\n\\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\\n\\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\\n\\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\\n\\n##### References (`references/`)\\n\\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\\n\\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\\n\\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\\n\\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\\n\\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\\n\\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\\n\\n- README.md\\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\\n- CHANGELOG.md\\n- etc.\\n\\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\\n\\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\\n\\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\\n\\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\\n\\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\\n\\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\\n\\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\\n\\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\\n\\n```markdown\\n# PDF Processing\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\\n[code example]\\n\\n## Advanced features\\n\\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\\n```\\n\\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\\n\\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\\n\\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\\n\\n```\\nbigquery-skill/\\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\\n└── reference/\\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\\n```\\n\\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\\n\\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\\n\\n```\\ncloud-deploy/\\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\\n└── references/\\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\\n```\\n\\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\\n\\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\\n\\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# DOCX Processing\\n\\n## Creating documents\\n\\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\\n\\n## Editing documents\\n\\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\\n\\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\\n```\\n\\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\\n\\n**Important guidelines:**\\n\\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\\n\\n## Skill Creation Process\\n\\nSkill creation involves these steps:\\n\\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\\n6. Iterate based on real usage\\n\\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\\n\\n### Skill Naming\\n\\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \\\"Plan Mode\\\" -> `plan-mode`).\\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\\n\\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\\n\\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\\n\\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\\n\\n- \\\"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\\\"\\n- \\\"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\\\"\\n- \\\"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\\\"\\n- \\\"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\\\"\\n\\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\\n\\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\\n\\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\\n\\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\\n\\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \\\"Help me rotate this PDF,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \\\"Build me a todo app\\\" or \\\"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \\\"How many users have logged in today?\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\\n\\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\\n\\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\\n\\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\\n\\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\\n```\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n\\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\\n\\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\\n\\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\\n\\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\\n\\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\\n\\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\\n\\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\\n\\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\\n\\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\\n\\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\\n\\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\\n\\n#### Update SKILL.md\\n\\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\\n\\n##### Frontmatter\\n\\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\\n\\n- `name`: The skill name\\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\\n  - Include all \\\"when to use\\\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \\\"When to Use This Skill\\\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \\\"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\\\"\\n\\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\\n\\n##### Body\\n\\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\\n\\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\\n\\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\\n```\\n\\nOptional output directory specification:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\\n```\\n\\nThe packaging script will:\\n\\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\\n   - Description completeness and quality\\n   - File organization and resource references\\n\\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\\n\\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\\n\\n### Step 6: Iterate\\n\\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\\n\\n**Iteration workflow:**\\n\\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\\n4. Implement changes and test again\\n\"}],\"isError\":false,\"timestamp\":1770867936062}}\n./state/sessions/2026-02-12T03-45-29-562Z_8f560b06-2c0a-4972-ad08-ec29d468133a.jsonl:14:{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"37c9a11f\",\"parentId\":\"7b246bb5\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T03:45:46.784Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"toolResult\",\"toolCallId\":\"bash_1770867945869_5\",\"toolName\":\"bash\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Initializing skill: github-manager\\n   Location: .pi/skills\\n   Resources: scripts, references\\n\\n[OK] Created skill directory: /home/runner/work/gitclaw/gitclaw/.pi/skills/github-manager\\n[OK] Created SKILL.md\\n[OK] Created scripts/\\n[OK] Created references/\\n\\n[OK] Skill 'github-manager' initialized successfully at /home/runner/work/gitclaw/gitclaw/.pi/skills/github-manager\\n\\nNext steps:\\n1.

Use when designing, structuring, or packaging skills with scripts, references, and assets.\\n---\\n\\n# Skill Creator\\n\\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\\n\\n## About Skills\\n\\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing\\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \\\"onboarding guides\\\" for specific\\ndomains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\\n\\n### What Skills Provide\\n\\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Concise is Key\\n\\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\\n\\n**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \\\"Does Codex really need this explanation?\\\" and \\\"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\\\"\\n\\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\\n\\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\\n\\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\\n\\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\\n\\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\\n\\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\\n\\nThink of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\\n\\n### Anatomy of a Skill\\n\\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\\n\\n```\\nskill-name/\\n├── SKILL.md (required)\\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\\n│   │   └── description: (required)\\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\\n```\\n\\n#### SKILL.md (required)\\n\\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\\n\\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\\n\\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\\n\\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\\n\\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments\\n\\n##### References (`references/`)\\n\\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.\\n\\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working\\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed\\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\\n\\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\\n\\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.\\n\\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Codex to use files without loading them into context\\n\\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\\n\\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\\n\\n- README.md\\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\\n- CHANGELOG.md\\n- etc.\\n\\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxiliary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\\n\\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\\n\\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\\n\\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Codex (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\\n\\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\\n\\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\\n\\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\\n\\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\\n\\n```markdown\\n# PDF Processing\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\\n[code example]\\n\\n## Advanced features\\n\\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\\n```\\n\\nCodex loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\\n\\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\\n\\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\\n\\n```\\nbigquery-skill/\\n├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\\n└── reference/\\n    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\\n    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\\n    ├── product.md (API usage, features)\\n    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\\n```\\n\\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Codex only reads sales.md.\\n\\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\\n\\n```\\ncloud-deploy/\\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\\n└── references/\\n    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\\n    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\\n    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\\n```\\n\\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Codex only reads aws.md.\\n\\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\\n\\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# DOCX Processing\\n\\n## Creating documents\\n\\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\\n\\n## Editing documents\\n\\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\\n\\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\\n```\\n\\nCodex reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\\n\\n**Important guidelines:**\\n\\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Codex can see the full scope when previewing.\\n\\n## Skill Creation Process\\n\\nSkill creation involves these steps:\\n\\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\\n6. Iterate based on real usage\\n\\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\\n\\n### Skill Naming\\n\\n- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; normalize user-provided titles to hyphen-case (e.g., \\\"Plan Mode\\\" -> `plan-mode`).\\n- When generating names, generate a name under 64 characters (letters, digits, hyphens).\\n- Prefer short, verb-led phrases that describe the action.\\n- Namespace by tool when it improves clarity or triggering (e.g., `gh-address-comments`, `linear-address-issue`).\\n- Name the skill folder exactly after the skill name.\\n\\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\\n\\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\\n\\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\\n\\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\\n\\n- \\\"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\\\"\\n- \\\"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\\\"\\n- \\\"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\\\"\\n- \\\"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\\\"\\n\\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\\n\\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\\n\\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\\n\\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\\n\\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \\\"Help me rotate this PDF,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \\\"Build me a todo app\\\" or \\\"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \\\"How many users have logged in today?\\\" the analysis shows:\\n\\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\\n\\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\\n\\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\\n\\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\\n\\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\\n\\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory> [--resources scripts,references,assets] [--examples]\\n```\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts,references\\nscripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path skills/public --resources scripts --examples\\n```\\n\\nThe script:\\n\\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\\n- Optionally creates resource directories based on `--resources`\\n- Optionally adds example files when `--examples` is set\\n\\nAfter initialization, customize the SKILL.md and add resources as needed. If you used `--examples`, replace or delete placeholder files.\\n\\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\\n\\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Codex to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Codex. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Codex instance execute these tasks more effectively.\\n\\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\\n\\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\\n\\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\\n\\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\\n\\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\\n\\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\\n\\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\\n\\nIf you used `--examples`, delete any placeholder files that are not needed for the skill. Only create resource directories that are actually required.\\n\\n#### Update SKILL.md\\n\\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\\n\\n##### Frontmatter\\n\\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\\n\\n- `name`: The skill name\\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Codex understand when to use the skill.\\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\\n  - Include all \\\"when to use\\\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \\\"When to Use This Skill\\\" sections in the body are not helpful to Codex.\\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \\\"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Codex needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\\\"\\n\\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\\n\\n##### Body\\n\\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\\n\\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\\n\\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\\n```\\n\\nOptional output directory specification:\\n\\n```bash\\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\\n```\\n\\nThe packaging script will:\\n\\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\\n   - Description completeness and quality\\n   - File organization and resource references\\n\\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\\n\\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\\n\\n### Step 6: Iterate\\n\\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\\n\\n**Iteration workflow:**\\n\\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\\n4. Implement changes and test again\\n\"}],\"isError\":false,\"timestamp\":1770867936062}}\n./state/sessions/2026-02-12T03-45-29-562Z_8f560b06-2c0a-4972-ad08-ec29d468133a.jsonl:14:{\"type\":\"message\",\"id\":\"37c9a11f\",\"parentId\":\"7b246bb5\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-12T03:45:46.784Z\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"toolResult\",\"toolCallId\":\"bash_1770867945869_5\",\"toolName\":\"bash\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"Initializing skill: github-manager\\n   Location: .pi/skills\\n   Resources: scripts, references\\n\\n[OK] Created skill directory: /home/runner/work/gitclaw/gitclaw/.pi/skills/github-manager\\n[OK] Created SKILL.md\\n[OK] Created scripts/\\n[OK] Created references/\\n\\n[OK] Skill 'github-manager' initialized successfully at /home/runner/work/gitclaw/gitclaw/.pi/skills/github-manager\\n\\nNext steps:\\n1.

Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)\\n- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements\\n- Example: Brand styling with \\\"Brand Guidelines\\\" -> \\\"Colors\\\" -> \\\"Typography\\\" -> \\\"Features\\\"\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...\\n\\n**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)\\n- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features\\n- Example: Product Management with \\\"Core Capabilities\\\" -> numbered capability list\\n- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1.

It provides tools to visualize the directory structure and identify critical files.\\n\\n## Tasks\\n\\n### 1. Visualization\\n- **Map Tree**: Use `scripts/map_tree.sh [depth]` to see the project structure (default depth 2). It automatically ignores common noise like `node_modules` and `.git`.\\n\\n### 2. Exploration\\n- **Find Entry Points**: Use `scripts/find_entry_points.sh` to locate main application files and configuration files.\\n- **Search for Patterns**: Use `grep` or `rg` to find specific keywords across the codebase.\\n\\n## Workflow: Orientation\\n1. Run `scripts/map_tree.sh` to see the high-level layout.\\n2. Run `scripts/find_entry_points.sh` to identify where the app starts.\\n3. Read the `package.json` or `requirements.txt` to understand dependencies.\\n4.
